Never again will your computer go to sleep. That lazy bugger, you know how it is. With our handy tool, your computer or phone will never go into sleep mode so you will never lose your progress if that is a concern.

For the bash version. first make the script executable by running

```bash
chmod +x sleepPreventer.sh
```

and then run it by

```bash
./sleepPreventer.sh
```
